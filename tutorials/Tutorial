I went through and documented everything important from last year. In this folder apart from this file are classes that you'll probably want to repurpose for next year.
You should feel no obligation to use these. They're what you'll be making yourselves ideally.

Objects:
A TalonSRX is a Talon motor controller class. To create a Talon Object use this syntax:

TalonSRX talonName = new TalonSRX(talonIDInteger);

Talons' speeds can be set like this:

talonName.set(ControlMode.percentOutput, talonOutputDouble);

so, if you had several talons on one side of a robot, like on a DriveTrain, you'd have to write several lines.
You can avoid this by making a MultiMotor. I attached a clean and documented MultiMotor class into this folder.
If the MultiMotor had a set method called 'set' you could use it the same way

MultiMotor motor = new MultiMotor(talonID1, talonID2);
