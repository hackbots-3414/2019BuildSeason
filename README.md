How to install this project:
1. Use cd and ls to navigate to a good directory. I like the desktop.
2. Verify 2019BuildSeason does not exist in the directory you are in by checking with ls.
3. Type 'git clone https://github.com/hackbots-3414/2019BuildSeason.git' this should download the repository and place it in a directory called 2019 Build Season
You can now open the project in VSCode.
